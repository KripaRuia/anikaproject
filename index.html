            Growing up in a North Indian family in Gujarat, I was exposed to two diametrically opposite cultures throughout my life. But there was something about the Gujarati culture, food and people alongside with dance and its history that always gravitated me towards the lifestyle of this state 
            
            This website was started to share my love for Gujarat with all. I hope you enjoyed your journey here and learned something about the culture, history, food and geography of Gujarat.
            Thank you
